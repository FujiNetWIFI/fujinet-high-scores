Game over search
     A48B? Looks like this is it.
     8673? NOPE.
     8D5C? NOPE. gets triggered on Start
     8D46? NOPE. Part of start

     86D2 is our wait for console switches, hiscore returns here

Hiscore is screen codes starting at $01, so add $0F to get screen code.

5 DLIs in original game

DLI 0 $8A32
DLI 1 $8A54
DLI 2 and 3 $8a70
DLI 4 $8AB9

Charset at $1000

Game uses its own deferred DLI. Disabling it completely disables graphic output.

So... We have to use POKEY for keycodes directly
      HRKEY modded to use KBCODE and SKSTAT.

The DLI mess:

Game uses DLIs to set color, and to do missile repositioning.

8a32 and 8a54 are static.
8a70 does two different things depending on where DLI fires
8aB9 loops back around to 8a32

Solution was to:

* self modify second to last DLI to point to hsdli2, which resets charset to game
* self modify first DLI to jump to our routine which does same as original, also setting to system charset
* patch the last DLI to point to code that resets charset to $1000

Not perfect. But doesn't crash. If you can do it better, please fix.
